=================================

    introduction/index

**Site API** is a lightweight layer built on top of eZ Platform's **Repository API**. It's purpose
is to solve common use cases, remove boilerplate code and provide better **developer experience**
for building websites. It will lower the entry barrier for newcomers and open most of the
development process to **roles other than PHP developer**.

With it, frontend developers, content builders and others will be able to do majority of the work
related to eZ Platform content modelling independently of PHP developers, without the need to work
in PHP. They will require only knowledge of Twig templates and view configuration in YAML.

If you are new to Site API, read the :doc:`Introduction </introduction/index>` first.
